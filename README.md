# Text Mining Using Python
We will discuss how to perform text mining operations using Python.
- Introduction to Text Mining
  - Tech skills covered: python list, string.split(), string.lower(), s.startwith(t), s.endwith(t), t in s, s.isupper(), s.islower(), s.istitle(), s.isalpha(), s.isdigit(), s.isalnum()
  - Other String Operations: like: s.splitlines(), s.joint(), s.strip(), s.rstrip(), s.find(), s.rfind(), s.replace(u,v)
  - Handling text sentences
  - Splitting sentences into words, words into characters
  - Finding unique words
  - Handling text from documents
